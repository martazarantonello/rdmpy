Data Requirements
-----------------

All demos require pre-processed data from the ``rdmpy.preprocessor`` module. Before running any demo, ensure:

1. Raw data has been downloaded from the Rail Data Marketplace
2. Data has been processed using: ``python -m rdmpy.preprocessor --all-categories``
3. Processed data is available in the ``processed_data/`` folder

See :doc:`getting_started` for data setup instructions.
